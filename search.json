    "text": "Preface\nStudents learning R need accessible data to practice their coding skills. In theory, R provides this through its many built‑in datasets. In practice, however, working with these datasets isn’t always as simple as it sounds.\nI wrote this book to close this gap between theory and reality.\nR offers multiple ways to access and handle built-in datasets, and many of those approaches assume familiarity with packages, environments, and memory management—skills beginners typically haven’t developed yet. This book removes that early complexity by giving you a clear, guided path to the essential techniques for working confidently with R’s built‑in datasets.",

    "text": "1.1 Contents\nWorking with R’s built‑in datasets can feel surprisingly challenging when you’re just getting started. This book is designed to remove that friction.\nIt won’t turn you into an expert overnight, but it will give you the practical skills you need to become confident and capable. Along the way, you’ll build a solid foundation that makes deeper exploration easy whenever you’re ready for it.\nThe approach is simple: Show, then Tell. You’ll see each idea demonstrated in real code first, and only then will we break down how and why it works.\nChapters 1 - 4\nThese chapters introduce the essentials of working with built‑in datasets, using examples from three popular R packages.\nYou’ll learn how to find, load, and explore datasets so you can start working with them immediately.\nChapter 5\nThis chapter presents a streamlined workflow that ties together the techniques from earlier chapters.\nThink of it as a quick‑reference guide you can return to whenever you need a refresher.\nChapter 6\nA bonus chapter that highlights several widely used datasets, explaining what makes them so popular and how they’re typically applied.\nYou’ll also get another lean workflow to support your future work.\nChapter 7\nThe final chapter wraps up your learning and offers suggestions for where to go next as you continue building your R skills.",

    "text": "4.7 Wrap-up\n\n4.7.1 Built-in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere’s variation within the R community regarding the use of the term “built-in” as it relates to discussing datasets contained in R packages.\nThe most strict interpretation is that only datasets contained in the datasets package should be called “built-in” since the datasets packages comes with base R and this package is automatically made available (loaded and added to the search path) each time an R session starts up. This interpretation also sometime refers to datasets contained in other packages as “package-specific” datasets.\nAn increasing common, more liberal, interprentation of “built-in” is that datasets contain in any R package can be referred to as “built-in” since it is literally built into the package. This book uses this more open interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n4.7.2 Other key points\n\nThe datasets package is unique among R packages.\nIts primary purpose is to provide datasets for learning and practicing R.\nThe datasets package is installed with R and is automatically available in every R session.\nThe datasets package provides the data() function, which can be used with any package to load a dataset into the global environment\nYou can also use data() to list the publicly available datasets contained in a package.",

    "text": "R’s built‑in datasets provide an ideal starting point for learning the language. They’re accessible, well‑documented, and designed to help you practice real data‑analysis skills. Throughout this book, the goal has been to give you a clear, consistent workflow for discovering these datasets, loading them, exploring their structure, and using them effectively in your own code.\nThe techniques you’ve learned form a practical foundation. They’re intentionally simple, reliable, and repeatable—exactly what you need when you’re building confidence with R. While there are additional ways to work with built‑in datasets, many of those alternatives require deeper knowledge of packages, environments, and memory management. Those tools can be powerful, but they also introduce nuances that sit beyond the scope of a beginner‑focused guide.\nBy applying the workflow presented here, you’ll be able to handle the vast majority of tasks you’re likely to encounter—easily 80% of the work you’ll want to do with R’s built‑in datasets.\nLearning R is a process, and you’ve taken an important step by learning how to work with the datasets that come built into the language. These datasets are more than practice material—they’re a gateway to understanding how R thinks about data. With the foundation you’ve built, you’re ready to move confidently into the broader world of data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.",
